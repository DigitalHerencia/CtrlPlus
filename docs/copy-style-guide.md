# Site Copy Style Guide

## Objective

Keep all user-facing copy minimalist, clean, and professional. Content should guide users through the product flow without hype, luxury language, or marketing exaggeration.

## Tone and voice

- Use plain, direct language.
- Prefer practical statements over promotional claims.
- Keep sentence structure short and readable.
- Focus on action clarity (what users can do next).

## Approved style patterns

- Primary CTA labels:
  - `Create Account`
  - `Sign In`
  - `View Features`
  - `Contact Us`
- Workflow framing:
  - `Browse → Preview → Schedule → Pay`
  - `clear digital booking path`
  - `secure checkout`
- Neutral descriptors:
  - `vehicle wraps`
  - `wrap options`
  - `account setup`

## Disallowed language patterns

Avoid adjectives and phrases that imply luxury, hype, or inflated claims in site copy.

Examples to avoid:

- `premium`
- `high-impact`
- `exclusive`
- `best-in-class`
- `world-class`
- `elite`
- `luxury`

If emphasis is needed, use operational outcomes instead (for example: `clear scheduling windows`, `secure payment confirmation`).

## Authoring checklist for copy edits

Before merging copy changes:

1. Confirm wording is concise and functional.
2. Confirm CTA labels match approved patterns.
3. Confirm no hype/luxury wording was introduced.
4. Confirm copy still aligns to the conversion flow (browse, preview, schedule, pay).
5. Confirm copy-only updates do not modify visual-system classes or layout structure.
