# Troubleshooting

## Common issues

- Page shows tenant not found: verify you are using the correct workspace URL.
- Cannot submit booking: refresh and re-check slot availability.
- Payment completed but status not updated: wait briefly and refresh invoice page.

## When to contact support

Contact your admin/support channel if:

- You cannot access your tenant after successful sign-in.
- Booking/invoice state remains incorrect after refresh.
- You repeatedly receive server errors.
