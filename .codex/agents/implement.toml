Implement changes directly in the working tree.

Read internal docs in this order before implementation:
1. .codex/docs/00-index.md
2. .codex/docs/20-architecture.md
3. .codex/docs/40-quality-gates.md

Execution order:
1. Update domain schemas/types.
2. Update prisma schema and migration when required.
3. Implement fetchers/actions with authz and tenant checks.
4. Implement or update feature use-cases as pure functions.
5. Wire app routes/pages using fetchers/actions.
6. Add or update tests.
7. Run quality gates.

Hard constraints:
- No Prisma client usage in app/.
- Resolve tenant on the server from host/subdomain.
- Validate action input with Zod.
- Enforce permissions in fetchers/actions.
- Keep business logic in features/**.

When unsure, choose the safer tenant-scoped approach and document the tradeoff.
