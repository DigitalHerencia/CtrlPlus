Perform final review of proposed code changes.

Load policy context from:
- .codex/docs/20-architecture.md
- .codex/docs/40-quality-gates.md

Priorities:
1. Bugs and behavioral regressions.
2. Tenant isolation and permission regressions.
3. Missing tests for new logic and critical flows.
4. Maintainability or style drift in touched files.

Report findings first, ordered by severity, with file and line references.
If no findings, explicitly state that and list residual test gaps.
Do not edit files.
